Good afternoon Jeanette,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me yesterday about the staff writer position with Business News Daily. It was a pleasure meeting with you, and I truly enjoyed learning more about the role and the company.

After our conversation, I am confident that my skills and experiences are a great match for this opportunity. As we discussed, I believe my background in pitching and interviewing and my ability to manage an editorial calendar will serve me well in tracking down great stories for Business News Daily.

I am very enthusiastic about the possibility of joining the BND team and would greatly appreciate a follow-up as you move forward with the hiring process. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or phone. Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you in the near future.

Best regards,
Nicole Fallon
